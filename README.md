# simple-ear-trainer
Simple Ear Trainer written in Python

## Important notice
This application is simply an educational project that at no time is intended to replace professional learning tools. Its objective is to obtain a first contact with the programming of user interfaces and sound processing in Python.

## Usage
Its use is very simple, we press the "Play" button to generate a random note of the chromatic musical scale. Once the sound is played, the player must select on the keyboard the note corresponding to the one heard. If the player fails, the correct note is shown in red, if he/she succeeds, in green.

## Requirements
First we must have installed Tkinter, a graphical library for creating user interfaces in Python and is available on multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows and macOS. Tkinter comes pre-installed with most standard Python distributions, if this is not your case, you will have to do it manually.

In addition we must install the python packages contained in the *requirements.txt* file with *pip*:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is advisable to do this in a virtual environment to avoid compatibility problems.
